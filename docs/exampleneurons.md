# Example neurons
Some example neuron ideas I thought up.

### Summer
Takes all inputs except the one it's facing at, then outputs the sum of all those inputs to the side it's facing at

### Negator
Reads from the side it's facing at and outputs on all other sides the opposite of that value (i.e. for input n, outputs are -n)

### Multiplicator
Outputs on the N/E/S/W sides the result of the top side times the bottom side.

### Reciprocator
Reads from the side it's facing at and outputs on all other sides the reciprocal of that value (i.e. for input n, outputs are 1/n)

### Battery
Constantly outputs a specific number on all sides. Mutatable.

### Timer
Outputs the number of ticks since simulation start.

### Modulo
Outputs on the N/E/S/W sides the result of the top side modulo the bottom side. (Creates a nice sawtooth wave when used with Timer)
