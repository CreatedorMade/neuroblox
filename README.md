# neuroblox
Data for the voxel-based neural networking API, Neuroblox.

## What is it?
Neuroblox is a Java API that is meant to be used for neural networking. Nets, or "brains" as they're called by the API, are three-dimensional structures containing a voxel grid of neurons. Neurons can be easily added to the API - the root neuron class is abstract and all neuron generation is to be handled by the end user (don't worry though, there is a function to help with generation).

## How does it work?
